In hindsight looping per round of chess (white and black moves) was a better implementation. But for unclear reasons didint want to run efficiently on the platform it was ran on.

-Performance limitations on the test platform.
-Implementation looping moves scrapped because of performance and replaced with subsequent loops
-Not sure if moves means only white moves, or black moves aswell
